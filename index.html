            <p> Dear <span class="name"></span>, <br> <br>

              Congratulations, you're a progressive! Portland is sure as beans the city for you! Like Snow White, you probably love all the creatures of the forest. Like actual Jesus, you probably are a big fan of helping the poor and helpless. Like Obama, you probably are more enthusiastic about the future than not (at least after the current presidency ends). Yes, you can and yes, you did get the answer you were hoping for from this quiz!!!

            <p> Dear <span class="name"></span>, <br> <br>

              Congratulations, you're a conservative! Most things about Portland probably bug the hell out of you! Like the villain from <em>Fern Gully</em>, you probably want to wipe out the forests if it makes you a quick buck.
